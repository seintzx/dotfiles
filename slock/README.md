# slock

## installation

- create a folder outside this repo
- `yay -G slock`
- `cd slock`
- `makepkg -o`
- `cd src/sloc-VER`
- copy the `config.h` here
- `sudo make clean install`

> NOTE: If you want to update `slock` repeat those passages

## configuration

Since you have to compile it every time you want to update there's no
configuration path where to save file, I keep it in my repo and copy it as
needed
