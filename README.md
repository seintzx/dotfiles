# README

This repos contains my config file, description and installation guide for most
of the thing I use.

`install.sh` may be unstable and work improperly, do not use it

> NOTE: The `packages.txt` contains all of my packages, see Wiki for more infos

## installation

Except for some stuff (like boot folder) that has to be done during arch
installation (but they are covered in my guide) I suggest you follow this order
to manually install packages:

- `yay`
- `yay -S systemd-boot-pacman-hook`
- `xdg`
- `slock`
- install fonts
- `st`
- everything else
