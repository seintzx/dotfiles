# htop

## installation

```bash
yay -S htop
```

## configuration

This folder contains my config file for `htop`, since config file changes with
changes made with `htop` open (like sorting columns) I added it to gitignore but
this version should have most of settings settled

## file path

- `~/.config/htop/htoprc`
