# rofi

## installation

I use rofi with three different tab, instead of `dmenu`
1. Run: to launch application, like `dmenu`
2. Clipboard: clipboard manager thanks to `greenclip`
3. Calculator: thanks to `qalc`

```
yay -S rofi
yay -S rofi-greenclip
yay -S qalculate-gtk
```

## configuration

This folder contains the config file for `rofi`, given that he uses the
`Xresources` file, so you can configure it in both file, just choose one.

## file path

- `~/.config/rofi/config`
- `~/.Xresources`
